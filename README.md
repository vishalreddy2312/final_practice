economy in several countries across the world. Here is the basic implementation on how quickly the virus spreads from one

in the grid and who are those people. The output will be the number of people already affected in a grid and number of people
who has higher chances of getting affected. Also at each time step how many people have high chances of getting affected.

Functions to be installed:
